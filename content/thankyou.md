# Thank you for reading my book!

If you've made it this far, thank you.

If you liked the book, follow me [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/mikitotakada) or [on Github](https://github.com/mixu). I love seeing that I've had some kind of positive impact.

I'd like to talk at developer-centric Node-related events in SF, so get in touch if you're arranging one.
